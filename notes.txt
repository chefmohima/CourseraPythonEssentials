1. What are docstrings?
Documentation strings which is compiled with code. Appears as the first string literal in a module/class/method definition.
Can be accessed with either:
-> help(object)
-> object.__doc__

2. What should docstrings contain?
Modules: Docstrings should tell about the classes, functions and exceptions
Classes: Docstrings should inform about methods and variables
Methods : Docstrings should inform about what the method is doing, paramaeters and return type
Standalone scripts: Docstrings should be like the usage and command line arguments

3. Syntax Error: syntax defines structure. If there is some structural irregularity, ex: missing quotes, wrong indentation etc. the
program will nto compile. These are syntax errors.
Examples:

-> print 'hello'    # bad input as print requires paratheses

-> print("Hello world!)   # bad token, mismatched quotes

-> def say_hello():
   print("Hello world!")    # bad input, nodef do_some_math(num1, num2):
   
-> def do_some_math(num1, num2):
    value = num1 + num2
return value                      # return outside function

-> 10 = x     # cant assign to literal, variable on the right side of assignment operator

-> def say_hello()
      print("Hello world!")     # bad input, missed punctuation ":" after method declaration
      
4. Runtime Errors

-> NameError: variable name is not defined/ function name is not defined
-> TypeError: trying to perform an action on a variable that its type does not support example: 
              - concatentating string and int
              - casting a string to int
              - function_name() takes exactly x arguments (y given): passing the wrong number of args
              - int object is not iterable: iterating over something which is not a sequence
              
-> IndexError: trying to access an index that is out of bound
-> TokenError: mostly gfor mismatched quotes/brackets


5. Reading from file
fileHandle.read() - > reads entire file into a string
fileHandle.readlines() - > reads entire file into a list where each item is a line. Not efficient for large files
to read large files : iterate over the fileHandle instead of the list: ex: for line in fileHandle.read()

6. Writing to a file.
Opening a file with 'w' mode will:
- create the file if it does not exist
- erase all content and write to the file if the file already exists
- use the 'a' mode to append to existing content in a file.


DICTIONARIES

1. Key-value pairs, values can change but keys cannot
# create empty dictionary 
empty_dict1 = {}
OR
empty_dict = dict()

# build a dict from a list of tuples
data = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')]      # list of tuples
dict_data = dict(data)   
# returns a dictionary: {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}

2. How to query the value of a key, ex we want to know the value associated with the key = "k"
-> d[k] will return the value iff the key k exists in the dictionary and a KEyError otherwise
-> d.get(k) will return the value iff k exists in the dcitionary else it returns None( but No error)
-> d.get(k, z): if key is not present, then return the value z. Second argument of the get method is optional.


3. Updating key values

d
Out[12]: {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}

d[1] = "ONE"                              # key exists in the dict
// {1: 'ONE', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}

4. Update when key does not exist:

d
Out[14]: {1: 'ONE', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}

d[4] = "FOUR"              # the key 4 does not exist so a new key will be added

d
Out[17]: {1: 'ONE', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'FOUR'}


#  Check if keys exist in dictionary
iterating over a dictionary is equivalent to iterating over its keys
Example:
d = {1:'a', 2:'b', 3:'c'}
1 in d
Out[3]: True

 Strings, numbers, and tuples work as keys, and any type can be a value.
